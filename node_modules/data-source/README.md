## About

A `DataSource` is the base `AsteroidModule` class for all data sources. Data sources provide APIs for reading and writing remote data from databases and various http apis.

### Creating a custom Data Source

To create a custom data source you must define a class that inherits from `DataSource`. This class should define all the required options using the [asteroid module option api](../asteroid-module) (eg. host, port, username, etc).

The inherited class must provide a property `adapter` that points to a [jugglingdb adapter](https://github.com/1602/jugglingdb#jugglingdb-adapters).
