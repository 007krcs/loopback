# LoopBack

LoopBack is a mobile backend framework that can run in the cloud or on your own servers.
It is built on [StrongNode](http://www.strongloop.com/strongnode) and open source Node.js
modules. Since LoopBack is built on open source, it is highly extensible and
familiar to developers already using Node.
Node.js leverages Javascript, the ubiquituous language of the web familiar to most 
developers.
