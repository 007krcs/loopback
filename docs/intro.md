# LoopBack

LoopBack is a mobile backend framework that can run in the cloud or on your own hardware.
It is built on [StrongNode](http://www.strongloop.com/strongnode) and open source Node.js
modules. 

LoopBack enables you to develop mobile applications with rich
functionality and data in your datacenter and the cloud.
Since LoopBack is built on open source, it is highly extensible and
familiar to developers already using Node.
Node.js leverages Javascript, the ubiquituous language of the web familiar to most 
developers.
